Please DO NOT use the code above to play the game. Instead, please download the compiled version from the website - https://tictactoe.mrkakisen.net/

Please note that line `58` is removed because it contains the IP of the server. To prevent people from downloading & modifying the game from GitHub to cheat in-game.

# Compiling
When a new version releases, I'll release it on GitHub and then compile it and upload it to the website shortly after.
